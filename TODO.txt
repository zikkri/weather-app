- inject weather service into component
- link up to api 
- have tabs between current / hourly? / 7 day /  14 day 
    - fire an event to fetch appropriate data when tab is clicked and switched to (async)
- maybe a toggle for farenheit or metric? (think thats celsius)
- make functions to return each data separately ( one for each type of weather that want to view ) 
- maybe make a diff component for the actual view ( instead of using AppComponent ) **** DEF DO this ****
